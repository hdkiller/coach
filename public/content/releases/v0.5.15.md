#### Sync Reliability Upgrades

We’ve significantly improved how Watts handles workout data, especially with our core platforms:

- **Smarter Intervals.icu Sync:** Introducing "Smart Sync Reconciliation" to ensure your workouts are ingested and reconciled more reliably, preventing data errors and redundant calls.
- **Better Data Handling:** Fixed several bugs related to workout stream data and map fallbacks for more accurate analysis.
- **Strava Warning:** We now clearly warn users connecting to Intervals.icu about potential Strava sync limitations, helping you manage your connections correctly.

### 🗺️ Next-Level Training Plan Wizard

We have completely overhauled the Training Plan builder to give you unprecedented control and insight into your season.

- **⚡ Backward Planning Engine:** Tell Watts your goal race date and readiness level, and the system will _automatically_ calculate the optimal training rhythms, periodization, and starting point to get you race-ready.
- **🗓️ Interactive Timeline Visualization:** See your entire plan structure at a glance with a new interactive timeline and phase editor. Easily tune individual weeks inline without leaving the plan dashboard.
- **🧘 Recovery Rhythm Control:** New options to select and visualize your ideal recovery cycles, making sure rest is perfectly integrated into your plan.
- **Goal Clarity:** The goal setup wizard has been redesigned to be URL-driven and visually improved, helping you clearly link events and training objectives.
- **Plan Overview Modal:** Instantly view a detailed summary of your current active training plan.

### 🧠 Smarter AI & Daily Check-ins

Your AI Coach is becoming more personalized and the daily routine is more robust.

- **Personal Context:** You can now provide a **Nickname** and specific **AI Context** in your profile settings. Your coach will use this information to make interactions more relevant and personal.
- **Contextual Opening Remarks:** Daily Check-ins now feature a specific opening remark, setting the context for your conversation and reducing repetitive questions.
- **Check-in Resilience:** The Daily Check-in modal is more robust, featuring dynamic loading messages and manual retry options to handle transient connection issues gracefully.

### ✨ Quality of Life & Usability

- **🗑️ Bulk Delete for Planned Workouts:** A massive quality-of-life improvement! You can now select and delete multiple planned workouts quickly.
- **Planned Metrics in Summaries:** Your Weekly Summary sidebar and modal now display planned metrics alongside actual results, making comparison easier.
- **Soft-Delete Chat Rooms:** You can now soft-delete chat rooms to declutter your messaging interface while preserving historical data.
- **Improved Calendar Wellness:** Enhanced display of wellness metrics directly in your training calendar and modal views.
