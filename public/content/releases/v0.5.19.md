# ✨ Release Notes: v0.5.19 – Deeper Insights, Smarter Fueling, and Structured Training Mastery

We've shipped a massive update focused on bringing you unparalleled control over your metabolic health, structured training, and overall recovery. This release introduces a new layer of personalization, safety, and visual polish.

Here’s what’s new in Coach Watts:

---

## 🔬 Next-Level Metabolic Intelligence & Safety

Your body is unique, and your coaching should be too. We've integrated powerful new systems to make your fueling strategy safer and more responsive than ever.

- **Metabolic Safety Floors (NEW!):** You can now set a **Metabolic Safety Floor** in your profile. This personalized failsafe ensures your daily calorie or carbohydrate availability never drops below a secure threshold, even during intense training blocks. We've set the default floor lower (to 70%) for safer, more conservative fallbacks.
- **Symptom-Based Fueling Overrides:** Coach Watts now integrates your tracked symptoms and "journey events" directly into your fueling strategy. If the AI detects signs of fatigue or metabolic strain, it will automatically override standard recommendations to prioritize recovery.
- **Fueling Strategy Dashboard:** A new, centralized dashboard gives you a deep dive into your metabolic strategy, including multi-day energy charts and a **weekly fueling grid** with analysis modals.
- **Carb Absorption Control:** Gain control over your fueling strategy by selecting personalized **carbohydrate absorption profiles** and visualizing your total Carb Balance directly in the UI.
- **Enhanced Glycogen Insight:** Glycogen projections now include contextual coach tips and improved advice based on new calibration signals.

## 💧 Predictive Hydration and Readiness

We’ve moved beyond simple water tracking to offer a sophisticated, predictive model for hydration management.

- **Hydration Debt Tracking:** The app now tracks your **hydration debt** and predicts passive rehydration over time.
- **Sweat Rate Estimation:** Core utilities now estimate your individual sweat rate, leading to significantly more accurate intra-workout and post-workout hydration recommendations.
- **Hydration Status Ring:** A new ring on your dashboard gives you an instant visual status of your hydration, with an easy-access modal to explain the science behind it.
- **Advanced Readiness Metrics:** We now support normalization and context integration for **HRV4Training** data, providing the AI with a richer understanding of your daily readiness.

## 🛠️ Structured Workout Planning and Visualization

Building and editing complex training sessions is now easier and more powerful than ever before, both in the calendar and in chat.

- **Workout Structure Editor:** You can now fully **edit the structure of your planned workouts**, including converting intervals and modifying steps. This provides powerful control for both athletes and coaches.
- **Advanced Workout Visualization:**
  - Charts now beautifully display complex, **nested interval structures**, making even the most advanced workouts easy to understand.
  - See visualizations for **cadence, pace zones, and HR ranges** integrated directly into your planned workout charts.
  - We've added **Strength Training** support to your Weekly Zone Distribution analysis!
- **Intervals.icu Export Optimization:** Exporting your structured workouts to platforms like Intervals.icu is cleaner and more precise, supporting recursive metrics and complex loops.

## 📱 User Experience & AI Transparency

We’ve refreshed key parts of the app for a sleeker, faster experience, especially on mobile.

- **High-Polish UI Refresh:** Enjoy a fresh, modern look across the landing pages and core application areas, complete with high-performance animations.
- **Improved Mobile Experience:** We've optimized layouts for edge-to-edge viewing on mobile devices and added **drag-and-drop support** to the activity and plan dashboards for easier scheduling on the go.
- **AI Tool Approval Toggle:** Gain full transparency and control over the AI. You can now enable/disable the requirement for **tool approval** before the AI executes actions (like scheduling a workout or updating nutrition settings).
- **Smarter Chat Context:** The AI is now proactively condensing and summarizing your chat history in the background, ensuring it always has the most relevant context for its recommendations.
