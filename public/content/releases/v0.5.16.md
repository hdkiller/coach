## 💳 Supporting the Mission: Introducing Subscription Plans

As Coach Watts grows, so do the costs of providing high-quality AI analysis and maintaining the infrastructure required for deep performance tracking. To ensure we can continue building the best training companion for you, we are introducing **Supporter** and **Pro** subscription tiers.

**The core functionality of the app remains exactly as it is today.** However, upgrading to a paid plan unlocks significant performance and intelligence boosts:

- **⚡️ Automated Background Analysis (Supporter & Pro):** No more manual refreshing. Your workouts, nutrition, and wellness data will be analyzed automatically via background jobs triggered by your incoming data. Your recommendations will be ready and waiting the moment you open the app.
- **💎 Gemini Pro Intelligence (Pro Only):** Pro subscribers gain access to the more powerful Gemini Pro model, providing even deeper insights and more nuanced training adaptations.

Your support helps us stay independent and focused on building the best tools for athletes. Check out the new **Billing** page in your settings to explore the plans!

## 🔗 New Integrations & Data Power-Ups

### Oura Ring Integration is Here! 🌙

Connect your Oura Ring to Coach Watts to bring sleep, readiness, and recovery data directly into your performance analysis. This gives the AI and your coach a complete picture of your total training load and recovery status.

- **Benefit:** Smarter training decisions based on genuine recovery data.

### Next-Level Training Intelligence 🧠

We've significantly upgraded the depth of our analysis:

- **Optimal Cadence Calculation:** Coach Watts now calculates your optimal cycling cadence based on anthropometric factors (your body measurements). Get more precise targets for efficiency!
- **Enhanced Training Load (CTL/ATL):** We've improved how training load is calculated and recorded, ensuring the charts and summary metrics (like your weekly intensity) are consistent and highly accurate.
- **Smarter Workout Adherence:** The AI is now better than ever at analyzing your completed workouts. It uses highly detailed structured plan steps to give you precise feedback on where you nailed the effort and where you missed the targets.

## 📈 Tools for Coaches: Dashboard Overhaul

Coaches, your dashboard just got a major upgrade to make athlete management clearer and faster:

- **Rich Athlete Cards:** The main athlete list is now modular, showing essential information like **adherence statistics** and **wellness history** right on the card.
- **Streamlined Management:** We've enhanced the coaching dashboard with dedicated sections for inviting and managing your roster of athletes.
- **Smoother Impersonation:** Moving between your coach view and your athlete's profile is now more seamless, making it easier to review data and adjust plans.

## ✨ User Experience & Stability Improvements

We spent a lot of time tightening the screws and polishing the interface:

- **Improved Billing & Plans:** We've introduced a clean, dedicated Billing page. Upgrading, downgrading, or managing your subscription is now much clearer and easier.
- **Better Mobile Experience:** If you save Coach Watts to your iOS home screen (as a Progressive Web App), you'll now see the proper app icon and enjoy a better full-screen experience. 📱
- **Consistent Chart Tooltips:** All performance charts now feature standardized, immediate feedback tooltips for better data comprehension.
- **Fitbit Reliability:** We’ve made the Fitbit integration more robust, especially when dealing with rate limits, ensuring your data syncs reliably.
- **Workout Acceptance Fixed:** We resolved an issue that occasionally prevented workout acceptance or incorrectly handled rest days. Training plan execution is now much smoother!
