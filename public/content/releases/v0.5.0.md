# Release v0.5.0

# Major Update Alert! Coach Watts v0.5.0: Smarter Plans, Multi-Sport, and Workout Sharing! 🚀

We've been hard at work making Coach Watts the most powerful and flexible training partner, and this release is packed with features focused on dynamic, event-driven planning.

Here’s what’s new in v0.5.0:

---

## 📅 Precision Planning: Race Events & Periodization

Your training is no longer a static calendar. We've introduced advanced event management so your plan works backward from your most important goals:

*   **Event-Driven Periodization:** You can now add key races, events, or trips to your schedule. Coach Watts will automatically structure your training blocks (base, build, peak) to ensure you hit peak fitness exactly when you need it. 🎯
*   **Goal Wizard:** Easily set up and manage all your upcoming competitive and target events with dedicated new pages and tools.

## 🧠 Smarter AI Coaching & Customization

The AI planner is now highly flexible, giving you more control over your week-to-week schedule and specific workouts:

*   **AI Week Planning with Instructions:** Have an unusual schedule or feeling fatigued? You can now chat directly with the planner, providing **custom instructions** (e.g., "Keep volume low due to a busy work week," or "Focus on sprint power this Sunday"). 🗣️
*   **On-the-Fly Workout Adjustments:** Easily modify any planned workout's **duration or intensity** right in the app. If you need 15 minutes less, or a slightly easier session, the plan adapts instantly.
*   **Personalized Coaching Messages:** Get helpful, personalized coaching tips, instructions, and motivational messages generated for your specific workouts before you start riding.

## 🏊‍♂️ Multi-Sport Support Has Arrived!

For all our triathletes, runners, and swimmers—or anyone who cross-trains—Coach Watts now fully supports managing multiple disciplines:

*   **Activity Type Management:** Specify the sport (cycling, running, swimming, strength, etc.) for each workout and manage your volume across all activities.
*   **Sport-Specific Views:** Workouts now render dynamic, sport-specific views, including heart rate zone tracking and stats for all activities, and pace/speed calculations for running and swimming.
*   **Strength Training Focus:** Planned workouts can now include a target area field to help you focus your strength training efforts.

## 💾 Sharing & Downloads for Any Platform

Get your structured workouts out of Coach Watts and onto your favorite device or platform:

*   **Workout Download:** Instantly download any structured workout in industry-standard **ZWO** (Zwift, TrainerRoad compatible) and **FIT** formats. 📤
*   **Easy Sharing:** Share individual planned workouts or entire training plans via a simple public link. Perfect for showing off a great session or getting feedback from a third-party coach.
*   **Visualization Tools:** New charts show your workout structure, including **power zone distribution** and power range ramps, so you know exactly what you're getting into.

## ✨ Improvements & Polish

*   **Account Deletion:** Added a straightforward option to delete your user account and data if needed.
*   **UI Consistency:** We've enforced a consistent dark mode theme for a smoother visual experience. 🌙
*   **Better Plan Management:** Improved cleanup and removal of old workouts when you abandon or regenerate training blocks.
